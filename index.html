        <img id="profile-pic" src="images\profile-pic.jpg">
        <p>I spent the last 7 years of my professional life as a Sales Specialist with a focus on providing exceptional quality
            to clients in Direct B2P sales. After reaching the pinnacle of my ability in this career, I felt it was time to
            apply the skills that I learned there to a new and engaging field. After pursuing secondary education in Full Stack
            Web development, I found a love for getting "hands-on" with projects and providing the same exceptional quality in a new way.</p>

        <p>As a developer, I hope to expand the reaches of businesses small and large. As I was once told, "The internet never closes,
            why not take advantage?" </p>
